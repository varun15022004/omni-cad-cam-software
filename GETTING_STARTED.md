# Getting Started with Project OmniCAD

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Wait for initialization:**
   - The application will load Pyodide (Python in browser)
   - This may take 30-60 seconds on first load
   - You'll see a loading screen with progress

3. **Feature Tree (Left Panel):**
   - Shows hierarchical structure of your design
   - Click to select items
   - Expand/collapse nodes with arrows

4. **Properties Panel (Right Panel):**
   - Shows properties of selected items
   - Edit parameters and see live updates

5. **Console (Bottom Panel):**
   - Output: System messages and feedback
   - G-Code: Generated manufacturing code
   - Analysis: Simulation results
   - Performance: System metrics

### Creating Your First Design

1. **Switch to Model mode** (top tab)

2. **Create a sketch:**
   - Click "New Sketch" in ribbon
   - Will create 2D sketching environment

3. **Add geometry:**
   - Use ribbon tools: Line, Circle, etc.
   - Add constraints: Distance, Parallel, etc.

4. **Create 3D features:**
   - Select sketch profile
   - Use Extrude, Revolve, Sweep, Loft

5. **Save your work:**
   - File menu > Save
   - Downloads .omniproject file

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### Python Backend (in Browser)
- **Core**: Application orchestration, feature tree, commands
- **Geometry**: BREP kernel, sketching, constraints
- **UI**: Interface management (stub)
- **Rendering**: 3D visualization (stub)
- **Utils**: Logging, events, mathematics

### JavaScript Frontend
- **Three.js**: 3D graphics and viewport
- **PyScript/Pyodide**: Python integration
- **Modern CSS**: Responsive, themed UI
- **Web APIs**: File access, storage

### Data Flow
1. User interaction in JavaScript UI
2. Commands sent to Python backend
3. Geometry computed in Python
4. Results sent back to JavaScript
5. 3D visualization updated in Three.js

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python test_omnicad.py
```

This validates:
- Core system functionality
- Geometry kernel operations
- Sketching and constraints
- File I/O operations
- Event system
- Async initialization
